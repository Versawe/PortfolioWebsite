            I was born in 1996 in Muskegon, Michigan. There I attended Muskegon Community College and received my Associate's in Science and Arts. I am currently in school at Ferris State University going for the Digital Animation and Game Design Bachelor's Degree. I have always loved playing games, and now I love creating them even more. I have learned many skills like: 2D and 3D animation, digital design, game development, interactive design, and much more. I am primarily in the game development track where I focus moslty on computer programming for interactive media.

            I have used all the various tools in the lists below during my years at college. My web development skills were gained from a Summer Internship at Versaco Industries LLC, where I was a Full-Stack Web Developer for multiple websites. My work experience at ADAC Automotive has taught me a lot about Python programming. Using python executables and scripts within Windows 10 or as plugins within Software to "automate the boring stuff" is where I gained my python experience. My main passion lies within the Game Development track. I have loved creating video games and apps using the Unity Game Engine, which I have had experience in since 2019 both in and out of college.
