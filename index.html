            I was born in 1996 in Muskegon, Michigan. There I attended Muskegon Community College and received my Associate's in Science and Arts. I am currently in school at Ferris State University going for the Digital Animation and Game Design Bachelor's Degree. I have always loved playing games, and now I love creating them even more. I have learned many skills like 2D and 3D animation, digital design, game development, and much more. I am primarily in the game development track where I focus moslty on computer programming for interactive media.

            I have used all the various tools in the lists below during my years at college. My web development skills was gained from a Summer Internship at Versaco Industries LLC where I did Full-Stack Web Development for multiple websites. My work experience at ADAC Automotive has taught me a lot about Python programming and using python executables and scripts within Windows 10 or other Software to automate the boring stuff. But my main passion lies within the Game Development tracks. I have loved creating videogames and apps using Unity, which I have had experience in since 2019 both in and out of college.
