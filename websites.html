            Web Development<br><br>Intro
        </p>
        <div class= "bodyContent">
            I did the Full-Stack Deveolpment for the following websites. HTML, CSS, & Javascript was used client-side, and the mySQLi class in PHP, mySQL, and XAMPP was used for serverside scripting and testing. I ended up posting the websites online throught 000webhost, but it was really only good for testing the websites than being an actual host. This page shows the examples of the two websites made by me in the Summer of 2020.

            Versaco Industries LLC
        </p>
        <div class= "bodyContent">
            Versaco Industries LLC was a website I made for my Dad. When he plans to retire he plans to do consulting because he is a workaholic and never wants to actually retire. With all jokes aside, I made a demo website for him, that was not completely finished, but it tells the viewers all about his past experience and what you can get from the website. This website is not finished and will not be online for a while, but it did not hurt to get a head start on it.

            Yoga with Emma
        </p>
        <div class= "bodyContent">
            Yoga with Emma was a website made for my sister to use as a virtual yoga instructor. With this website I was able to setup accounts, a paid subscription service through PayPal, and a video and blog post archive. This website was hosted on 000webhost, but only for testing purposes. This website is also currently not live, but I do have supporting images and videos to show off my work.
