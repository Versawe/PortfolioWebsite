            Python Scripts<br><br>Intro
        </p>
        <div class= "bodyContent">
            I started my computer programming career back in 2017 and primarily used Python as my preferred language. My current job uses Software that requires python knowledge to help automate tasks, so lately I have been getting back into Python and it is good to be back. The following projects are some personal programs I made using Python. If you are a Python user, please feel free to use some of my scripts. They can help ease doing pip installs or creating executables for your own scripts.

            Easy PyInstaller
        </p>
        <div class="bodyContent">
            I developed a program that would automatically create an executable from your python scripts. All you need to do is click-and-drag the py file into the window and click the confirm button. The program will automatically create the program in the same directory as the py file. It does this by grabbing the file name and file path and executing the 'pyinstaller --onefile filename.py' in the Command Prompt through this script automatically. This will make it easier to use the PyInstaller module or make it usable for people who are uncomfortable with the Command Prompt. Of course, Pyinstaller will need to be installed through pip first. This will only work on devices using Windows.

            Easy Pip Install
        </p>
        <div class="bodyContent">
            The Easy Pip Install is similar to the Easy Pyinstaller program that I have deveolped. The difference, of course, is using pip install easily, instead of the PyInstaller module. Pip, being the tool python programmers use to install modules, is commonly used through the Command Prompt or Powershell. This program includes a single text-form entry where you type the module you would want to pip install and the program does the rest. The program will automatically enter '-m pip install modulename --user' into the Command Prompt where python is installed on your PC (will automatically find it on your drive). This program is a powerful tool that helps making installing new python modules much easier. This will only work on devices using Windows.<br><br>
