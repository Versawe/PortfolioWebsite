            Game Development<br><br>Intro
        </p>
        <div class= "bodyContent">
            Developing video games and other types of interactive media has become an enjoable hobby of mine. I turned this into a career path when I chose to go to Ferris State University for the Digital Animation and Game Design Bachelor's degree. My primary tools for game development is the Unity Game Engine, but I have dabbled in the Unreal Engine 4. Most of these projects below were collabrative endeavors developed in my college classes with other students.

            Escape the Beyond
        </p>
        <div class= "bodyContent">
            Escape the Beyond is my Senior Capstone Project. Escape the Beyond is a first-person psychlogical horror game. The brief summary for the story is that you awake in a strange mansion with amenesia and have to face the horrors of your sinful past while trying to escape from this strange space. The goal of this game is break the 4th wall which will aid in making the player feel uncomfortable with the experience, have intense chase interactions with smart AI, and help aid the enviornment and tell the story through audio. Some huge inspirations to make this game are: The Slender Man games, Pacify, 
            Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, and Resident Evil 7. This game is fully developed in Unity with purchased assets from the Unity Asset Store, and the audio being engineered in FLS and Adobe Audition. The deveolpment of this game was started in August 2020 and planned to release in December 2021.</div>

            Cadillac XT6 Safety Features App
        </p>
        <div class="bodyContent">
            Cadillac XT6 Safety Features App is a project developed in my Junior Project class in college. The goal of this project was to develop a phone application that would display 3 different safety features in an interactive style for the Cadillac XT6. In the Junior Project class, our professor finds multiple clients that have a project in mind that they would like to get accomplished within a semester. The students have a choice to team up and pick which clients they would like to work for. I decided to go with the Cadillac group because of my experience in the automotive industry. Cadillac wanted us to make them a phone app that possible car retailers could use to inform employees or show customers the safety features of the Cadillac XT6. For the semester we decided to focus on three safety features: Rear Auto break, Cross Traffic Control, and Super Cruise. We showcase each of these safety features in their own scenes connected by a main menu. We used the touch input controls in Unity to develop the app, and got all the 3D assets from Cadillac. UI art was created by our group.This project was developed back in early 2020.

            Space Pirates
        </p>
        <div class="bodyContent">
            Space Pirates is an abandoned Capstone Project that I started on early 2019. It was going to be a free-roaming, 2D, top-down dungeon crawler game that took place in outer space. The story being that you were runaway convicts from a universal space police force. The goal would be to go around in the game collecting resources from destroying planets and other space ships in order to level up your ship to the point of being confident enough to face the mothership located in the middle of the map. I started developing this game in Unity and created the art assets in Illustrator, and colored them in Photoshop. The idea of updgrading and customizing the ship parts also would effect the abilitys of the ship such as: type of fire power, ship HP, ship shield, and boost distance. I also experimented with using colliders on particles, for the plan was to use particles as the ship's bullet aesthic. Althought the project was abandoned, I was still able to learn a lot and have a cool demo of some of the mechanics I had intially planned for the final product.

            2D Platformer
        </p>
        <div class="bodyContent">
            This was a short Summer project back in 2019 to keep myself fresh in-between semesters. The idea for the game was to be about tiny pet animals getting together to save their owners who were all kidnaped. I was only able to make one level out of this project, and a few sandbox prototype scenes. This game ended up being a challenging one, as you can see from the video below. All art and programming was done by me and my sister, who helped with the parallax background. The game was deveolped in the Unity Game Engine, the art was drawn in Illustrator and then colored in Photoshop. All the art was made by me as a fun change of pace from my usual projects, I am not an artist. A huge inspiration for me to make this game is from Cuphead and the Mario Bros games.

            AR Configurator
        </p>
        <div class="bodyContent">
            The AR Configurator was Developed back in 2019 and it's main purpose was to let users customize a virtual AR to see what they would like to purchase physically. With over 50 different 3D models and 9 different textures for them, this will have all AR's created unique and to the user's preferences. This AR Configurator was made in the Unity Game Engine, while the assets were created in 3Ds Max. This was a part of a class project for my Project Documentation & Management class at Ferris State University. <br><br>

        <div class="bodyContent">
            This was a project made for my Interactive Design class at Ferris State University. This was created as a demo for a VR UI example. It was ended up made into a non-VR, PC build for fun. We took a humorous approach at it while also sending a horrific message that "Drugs are Bad". The Audio was developing in FL Studios, the application was made in Unity, and the Assets were purchased from the Unity Asset Store. All Assets were free assets.

            An Untitiled Dungeon Crawler DX
        </p>
        <div class="bodyContent">
            This was a school project at Ferris State University in the Game Programming class. The project is a top-down dungeon crawler with a short level and an intense final boss fight! The player has 9 different mechanics all made by 3 different developers within 3 months, on top of AI development and level design. This project was created in Unreal Engine 4 and the assets were created in 3Ds Max. This was made back in 2019 and the video was made by Matt Findley and uploaded here by Eric Versaw.

            Shaft Sprinter
        </p>
        <div class="bodyContent">
            Join Urish, the greedy Dwarf, on a run down the mining shafts and escape the lava flow heading your way! In this Endless Runner you can attack & dodge obstacles, upgrade your stats, and purchase power ups. These mechanics will aid you in the goal of gaining the most points any Dwarf could ever hope for. Keep a good balance between high health and a manageable encumbrance. Being too greedy can lead to slowing Urish down, therefore, making it easier for the lava to catch up to you.Collecting coins raises your encumbrance meter, which slows down the player's speed. As the score gets higher, the lava flow gains more speed which makes the player rely more on power ups to keep ahead. If you get hit by obstacles three times, without healing using Soaps and Bandages at the shop, you will get a game over. If the lava flow catches up to your avatar, you get a game over. If your emcumbrance bar gets below 0, you get a game over. All these scenarios add to the challenge for making the player make smart purchases at the right time in the shop and having the player keep good attention on both health and encumbrance bars. This game was developed in Unity and uses assets from the Unity Asset Store. Shaft Sprinter was a student made project back in early 2019.
