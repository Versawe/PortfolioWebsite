            I was born in 1996 in Muskegon, Michigan. There I attended Muskegon Community College and received my Associate's in Science and Arts. I am currently in school at Ferris State University going for the Digital Animation and Game Design Bachelor's Degree. I have always loved playing games, and now I love creating them even more. I have learned many skills like 2D and 3D animation, digital design, game development, and much more. I am primarily in the game development track where I focus moslty on computer programming for interactive media.
