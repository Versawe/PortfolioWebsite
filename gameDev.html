            Game Development<br><br>Escape the Beyond
        </p>
        <div class= "bodyContent">
                Escape the Beyond is my Senior Capstone Project. Escape the Beyond is a first-person psychlogical horror game. The brief summary for the story is that you awake in a strange mansion with amenesia and have to face the horrors of your sinful past while trying to escape from this strange space. The goal of this game is break the 4th wall which will aid in making the player feel uncomfortable with the experience, have intense chase interactions with smart AI, and help aid the enviornment and tell the story through audio. Some huge inspirations to make this game are: The Slender Man games, Pacify, 
            Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, and Resident Evil 7. This game is fully developed in Unity with purchased assets from the Unity Asset Store, and the audio being engineered in FLS and Adobe Audition. The deveolpment of this game was started in August 2020 and planned to release in December 2021.<br><br>

            Cadillac XT6 Safety Features App
        </p>
        <div class="bodyContent">
            Cadillac XT6 Safety Features App is a project developed in my Junior Project class in college. The goal of this project was to develop a phone application that would display 3 different safety features in an interactive style for the Cadillac XT6. In the Junior Project class, our professor finds multiple clients that have a project in mind that they would like to get accomplished within a semester. The students have a choice to team up and pick which clients they would like to work for. I decided to go with the Cadillac group because of my experience in the automotive industry. Cadillac wanted us to make them a phone app that possible car retailers could use to inform employees or show customers the safety features of the Cadillac XT6. For the semester we decided to focus on three safety features: Rear Auto break, Cross Traffic Control, and Super Cruise. We showcase each of these safety features in their own scenes connected by a main menu. We used the touch input controls in Unity to develop the app, and got all the 3D assets from Cadillac. UI art was created by our group.This project was developed back in early 2020.<br><br>

            Space Pirates
        </p>
        <div class="bodyContent">
            Space Pirates is an abandoned Capstone Project that I started on early 2019. It was going to be a free-roaming, 2D, top-down dungeon crawler game that took place in outer space. The story being that you were runaway convicts from a universal space police force. The goal would be to go around in the game collecting resources from destroying planets and other space ships in order to level up your ship to the point of being confident enough to face the mothership located in the middle of the map. I started developing this game in Unity and created the art assets in Illustrator, and colored them in Photoshop. The idea of updgrading and customizing the ship parts also would effect the abilitys of the ship such as: type of fire power, ship HP, ship shield, and boost distance. I also experimented with using colliders on particles, for the plan was to use particles as the ship's bullet aesthic. Althought the project was abandoned, I was still able to learn a lot and have a cool demo of some of the mechanics I had intially planned for the final product.<br><br>

        <div class="bodyContent">
            This was a short Summer project back in 2019 to keep myself fresh in-between semesters. The idea for the game was to be about tiny pet animals getting together to save their owners who were all kidnaped. I was only able to make one level out of this project, and a few sandbox prototype scenes. This game ended up being a challenging game, as you can see from the video below. All art and programming was done by me and my sister, who helped with the parallax background. The game was deveolped in the Unity Game Engine, the art was drawn in Illustrator and then colored in Photoshop. A huge inspiration for me to make this game is from Cuphead and the Mario Bros games.<br><br>
